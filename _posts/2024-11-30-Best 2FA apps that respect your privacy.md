Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an extra layer of security when we try to log in to certain websites. It's used to enhance your security and is highly recommended, while there are various 2FA methods like hardware keys, Apps, SMS, etc. Today, we will cover the Apps.
Authenticator apps implement a security standard called Time-Based One-Time Password, or TOTP. It's a 6-digit code (usually) generated by your authenticator app every 30 seconds.
Even if a hacker gets one six-digit code, there is no way for them to reverse that code to get the original secret or otherwise be able to predict what any future codes might be.
So to put it in simple language, this is how 2FA works
1. Something you know: This is typically your password, which you enter as usual.
2. Something you have: This is often a code sent to your phone (via SMS or a specialized authentication app) or generated by a hardware token. You enter this code after your password.
3. Something you are: This category is a little more advanced, and might include the biometric pattern of a fingerprint, an iris scan, or a voiceprint.
Disclaimer and Criteria for the chosen Apps
The apps I have chosen here are based on the following criteria:
They must be FOSS (free and open source)
allows for transparency and enables other developers to review, audit, and contribute to the codebase.
Must not sync to a third-party cloud sync service to back up
should provide alternative backup options that prioritize user privacy and data sovereignty.

Disclaimer
This is based on my research and experience, so always consider researching yourself before choosing the listed apps. I am not affiliated with any of them; this is solely based on my genuine recommendation, cheers.
