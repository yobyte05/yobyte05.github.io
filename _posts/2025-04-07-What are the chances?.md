One day, I thought about my existence and the chances of being somewhere I wanted to be. That made me think of life in general, existence.
I found a cool article by [Dr. Ali Victor Binazir](https://happinessengineering.com/) on the chances of our existence. The number is very, very small, almost zero. I was surprised that it is so tiny, yet we exist.
This person did a whole calculation, starting with the probability of our parents meeting and continuing to the probability of our ancestors reproducing successfully.
After all the calculations, the probability of existing becomes  $$1:10^{2,685,000}$$, which is another way of saying almost ZERO.
If the probability of my existence is too small, yet I exist, what are the chances of achieving something great for a broke college dropout in his 20s living in a third-world country?
The odds could be against me, but it's not impossible. Many have done it in the past with even more struggles and shortcomings.
Achievement won't just be affected by external factors; there are also internal factors. 
Overcoming them would probably be the biggest challenge here. Nothing won't happen overnight, but after a year of hard work on the things I want to achieve, I can tell if I'm heading in the right direction.
I like the idea of sticking to something for at least three years before giving up and pursuing another goal.
There is nothing I want in this life more than freedom and independence. I don't want to follow any other person's path; I want to do it my way. I would rather be wrong following my path than following another man's footsteps.
In the end, I want to be on my deathbed and mumble Frank Sinatra's song.
